# JS-Questions
This is a repository I set up so I can practice difficult JavaScript questions. This includes Algorithms, Data Structures, and more. These questions are set up to be similar to the types of whiteboard questions that are asked during job interviews at some of the top tech companies in the world.

Below I have two resources that you can use to practice for your own coding interviews. The first is a PDF of in-depth technical JavaScript questions, and the second is a PDF file that a user can print to make their own coding interview question flash cards. This can be used to have the question and instructions facing up and you can practice writing the answer on a whiteboard, once completed you can flip over the card to see the solution and check how you did.
